# Quinn — The Flowchart Architect  
**From Clutter to Clarity**

I help people make sense of messy work.  
I take what’s in their heads and turn it into clear steps that anyone can follow.  
That’s called process documentation — and I build it from start to finish.

### What I Build
- **Level 1:** Big-picture roadmaps that show how everything connects  
- **Level 2:** Simple diagrams that explain what’s happening and who’s involved  
- **Level 3:** Step-by-step flowcharts that show how work moves from start to finish  
- **Level 4:** Written guides that explain who does what and when  
- **Level 5:** Work instructions that show exactly how to do each task  

### Current Projects
- Making a full set of process documents for the **CMS SMC process**  
- Creating easy templates for teams to write down what they do  
- Trying new ways to use AI to help people document their work faster  

### Mission
My goal is to help people see their work clearly.  
When people can see what they do, they can fix what’s broken, share what works, and build better systems.  
That’s how we go *from clutter to clarity.*
