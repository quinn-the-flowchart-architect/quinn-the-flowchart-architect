# Quinn the Flowchart Artist  

I'm Quinn the Flowchart Artist. I transform complex and complicated process information into gorgeous, quick-to-grasp process illustrations.

I create process visuals for all 5 levels within the process documentation hierarchy:

| **Level** | **Description** | **Example Visuals** |
|------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **1**    | Shows the complete lifecycle of a system or program â€” the highest view of how all major stages connect. | Lifecycle Diagram |
| **2**    | Breaks the lifecycle into phasez and shows how components interact within and across phases. | Lifecycle Roadmap, Context Diagram |
| **3**    | Maps the detailed flow of work from start to finish, showing all steps and handoffs. | End-to-End Process Map |
| **4**    | Describes each process in clear steps and visuals to explain who does what and when. | Process Flow Narrative, Process Flow Chart |
| **5**    | Provides the most detailed, task-level guidance for completing specific work. | Work Instructions, How-To Article |
